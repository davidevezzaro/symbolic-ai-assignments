# Symbolic Artificial Intelligence Assignments - Autumn 2023

This repository contains a collection of assignments completed as part of the *Symbolic Artificial Intelligence* course at Vilnius University during the Autumn semester of 2023.

## What is Symbolic AI?

Symbolic Artificial Intelligence, also known as Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI), focuses on the use of high-level, human-readable symbols and logic to represent and solve problems. This paradigm is rooted in formal logic, rule-based systems, and structured knowledge representation, such as semantic networks, ontologies, and expert systems. Symbolic AI emphasizes reasoning and decision-making based on explicit knowledge representation.

## Assignment List

Below is a structured outline of the assignments. Each entry includes the title of the assignment and its brief description. 

- **Hanoi Tower**
  - Description: solves the Hanoi Tower problem recursively.

- **Knights Tour**
  - Description: solves the [Knights Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour) problem considering it as a production system.

- **DFSLabyrinth**
  - Description: an agent has to exit a labyrinth starting from an arbitrary location. Constraints: the code must use DFS search and a backtracking algorithm.

- **BFSLabyrinth**
  - Description: an agent has to exit a labyrinth starting from an arbitrary location. Constraints: the code must use BFS search and a backtracking algorithm.

- **Forward Chaining**
  - Description: implements a forward chaining algorithm. Forward chaining is logical reasoning method that systematically applies inference rules to these facts to deduce new facts, progressing step by step. This process continues until either the desired conclusion is derived, or no more rules can be applied.

- **Backward Chaining**
  - Description: implements a backward chaining algorithm. Wile forward chaining is data-driven and explores all possible conclusions, backward chaining is goal-driven and works backward to verify specific goals.
